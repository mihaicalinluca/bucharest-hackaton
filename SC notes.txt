### Dynamic Reward Auto Compound Staking SC

	## SC structure

		- stake TOKENs -> receive STAKED-TOKEN MetaESDT with stake day as attribute (use transfer Role)

		*ESDTTransferRole : this role enables transfer only to specified addresses. The addresses with the transfer role can transfer anywhere.

		- dynamic staking pool (daily reward is set and divided between users that staked)
		- auto-compound once a day through a bot that triggers the function (owner only)


	## Bot

		- bot.py that calls the SC once a day

	## Frontend
